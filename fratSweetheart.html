    <img src="fratBarbie.jpeg" style="width:250px;">
    <p>Let’s be honest, you have spent more nights in Fiji than you have in your own bedroom.</p>
    <p>Do you really need to place that SHEIN order for 5 going out tops, because let's be honest, what you really need are a pair of new frat shoes.</p>
    <p>You are spontaneous, outgoing, and have probably caught frat flu at least 4 times this year (you’ll build that immunity eventually don't worry).</p>
