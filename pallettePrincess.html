    <h2> PALLETTE PRINCESS BARBIE </h2>
    <img src="palleteBarbie.jpg" style="width:250px;">
    <p>When I walk by you, I literally hear Bob Marley playing and you smell like flowers and strawberries.</p>
    <p>I see you doing yoga while simultaneously painting the UT Tower at the Main Mall at 8 AM, working the UT farm stand, and feeding the squirrels and I always think “WOW, she’s so cool.”</p>
    <p>You are reasonable, calm, and thoughtful and please tell me your secret on how you are never stressed!</p>
