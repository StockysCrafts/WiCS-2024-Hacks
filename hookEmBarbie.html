    <h2> HOOKEM BARBIE </h2>
    <img src="hookemBarbie.jpeg" style="width:250px;">
    <p>You literally bleed burnt orange and lowkey secretly wish Matthew McConaughey was your dad.</p>
    <p>Being a longhorn has been your dream since you learned how to talk and your hand is stuck in the hookâ€™em pose (are you okay).</p>
    <p>During football season, you basically live in the stadium and can always be found wearing cowboy boots. </p>
    <p> You have so much spirit, enthusiasm and energy and you love yourself a cold celsius.</p>
