    <p>Hey girl, I just wanted to remind you that your classes are in person so please get out there and touch some grass! .</p>
    <p>Being a longhorn has been your dream since you learned how to talk and your hand is stuck in the hook’em pose (are you okay).</p>
    <p>Please stop ignoring your friends’ texts asking if you wanna hang out and explore more places on campus other than your bedroom. </p>
    <p> You’re an introspective, calm, and easygoing individual and I respect that (please remember to take your vitamin D supplements).</p>
